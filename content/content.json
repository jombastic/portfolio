      "description": "For the Museum of the Future website, I contributed to the development and maintenance of its front-end, ensuring a seamless and visually captivating user experience. Leveraging Vue.js, HTML, and CSS, I built new features and pages while enhancing existing ones to align with the museum's forward-thinking ethos. I implemented a new payment system using the Network International (N-Genius) API, providing flexibility to toggle between payment systems based on client requirements. Additionally, I upgraded the site's security by replacing reCAPTCHA v2 with v3. These updates, alongside interface improvements, ensured a streamlined and secure journey for visitors exploring the museum online. Technologies used included JavaScript, Vue.js, Docker, and Git, with efficient project management supported by Jira.",
